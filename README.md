# Slacktivity

Do you want to know **right away** when your users do something **really important**? Slacktivity is a lightweight analytics library that allows you to send crucial user activity directly to your team's Slack.

# Why use Slacktivity?

Slacktivity has a different use case than traditional analytics platforms such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com). These platforms are fantastic for gathering tons of data on users and giving a clean interface to later interpret user behavior. Slacktivity, on the other hand, shines when there are *special* and *relatively rare* user events that you wanted to be notified of *right away*.

Some examples of when Slacktivity would be useful are:

* You're an early stage startup with only a few users, and you want to be notified any time a user logs in.
* You're a SaaS company that just released a new, special feature to a small set of customers, and you want to know exactly when your customers use the new feature, and how they're using it.
* You have a crucial feature that should never break, but you want to be notified *immediately* if it does.
